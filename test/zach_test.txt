;	ant run < test/zach_test.txt
; (or)
; 	java -jar build/grammar.jar < test/zach_test.txt
; (or)
;	./run-grammar.sh < test/zach_test.txt
;
; The output should be...
;	1
;	x is nonzero
;	x is zero

make "x 1

; ZERO.equals(1) is false, so this will execute the first time.
while [ :x ] [
	; Print the value of X
	print :x
	
	; Print whether x is zero or not
	ifelse :x [ (print "x "is "nonzero) ] [ (print "x "is "zero) ]
	
	; Make X zero.  This will cause the loop to exit.
	make "x 0
	
	; Again, print it.
	ifelse :x [ (print "x "is "nonzero) ] [ (print "x "is "zero) ]
	
	; Note that the last line MUST (!!!!) have a blank after it, or all hell breaks loose
